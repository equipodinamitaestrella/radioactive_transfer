# Ozone's Radiative Transfer

## Summary

## Introduction
Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a highly reactive gas whose molecules are comprised of three oxygen atoms. Its concentration in the atmosphere naturally fluctuates depending on seasons and latitudes, but it generally was stable when global measurements began in 1957. Groundbreaking research in the 1970s and 1980s revealed signs of trouble.<br>

Ozone absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun (particularly harmful UVB-type rays,) in a layer of the atmosphere called the stratosphere, the ozone layer is a sunscreen, shielding the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation. Exposure to UVB radiation is linked with increased risk of skin cancer and cataracts, as well as damage to plants and marine ecosystems. Atmospheric ozone is sometimes labeled as the "good" ozone, because of its protective role, and shouldn't be confused with tropospheric, or ground-level, "bad" ozone, a key component of air pollution that is linked with respiratory disease.<br>

### Ozone Layer's Depletion

In 1974, Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland, two chemists at the University of California, Irvine, published an article in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/249810a0.pdf">Nature</a> detailing threats to the ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases. As they reach the stratosphere, the sun's UV rays break CFCs down into substances that include chlorine.

The groundbreaking research—for which they were awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in chemistry—concluded that the atmosphere had a “finite capacity for absorbing chlorine” atoms in the stratosphere.

One atom of chlorine can destroy more than 100,000 ozone molecules, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, eradicating ozone much more quickly than it can be replaced.

Molina and Rowland’s work received striking validation in 1985, when a team of English scientists found a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica that was later linked to CFCs. The "hole" is actually an area of the stratosphere with extremely low concentrations of ozone that reoccurs every year at the beginning of the Southern Hemisphere spring (August to October). Spring brings sunlight, which releases chlorine into the stratospheric clouds. <br>
